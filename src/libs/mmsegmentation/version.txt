    [Fix] bugfix/avoid-runner-iter-in-vis-hook-test-mode   (#3596)
    
    ## Motivation
    
    The current `SegVisualizationHook` implements the `_after_iter` method,
    which is invoked during the validation and testing pipelines. However,
    when in
    [test_mode](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation/blob/main/mmseg/engine/hooks/visualization_hook.py#L97),
    the implementation attempts to access `runner.iter`. This attribute is
    defined in the [`mmengine`
    codebase](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmengine/blob/main/mmengine/runner/runner.py#L538)
    and is designed to return `train_loop.iter`. Accessing this property
    during testing can be problematic, particularly in scenarios where the
    model is being evaluated post-training, without initiating a training
    loop. This can lead to a crash if the implementation tries to build a
    training dataset for which the annotation file is unavailable at the
    time of evaluation. Thus, it is crucial to avoid relying on this
    property in test mode.
    
    ## Modification
    
    To resolve this issue, the proposal is to replace the `_after_iter`
    method with `after_val_iter` and `after_test_iter` methods, modifying
    their behavior accordingly. Specifically, when in testing mode, the
    implementation should utilize a `test_index` counter instead of
    accessing `runner.iter`. This adjustment will circumvent the issue of
    accessing `train_loop.iter` during test mode, ensuring the process does
    not attempt to access or build a training dataset, thereby preventing
    potential crashes due to missing annotation files.
